# HFP-QSMGAN: QSM from homodyne-filtered phase images

Source code for the models presented in the paper. See ```hfp_qsmgan.py``` for help on how to train and use the models.

The code assumes that the different echoes for the target GRE/QSM images are located in ```<gre_mag_dir/qsm_dir>/TE<#echo number>```.
